  [#14](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/14)

* New config option `use_safe_filenames` encodes unsafe characters when
  generating filenames. By default, documentation may receive filenames like

  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

## 0.7.3

##### Breaking

  [Shmuel Kallner](https://github.com/shmuelk)

  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#226](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/226)

  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#475](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/475)

  source files.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#586](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/586)

## 0.6.3

##### Breaking

* None.

##### Enhancements

  [Gurrinder](https://github.com/gurrinder)
  [#503](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/503)

  [Karl Bowden](https://github.com/agentk)
  [#435](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/435)

* Section headings can now include additional markdown content using the
  `--abstract` option.  
  [Karl Bowden](https://github.com/agentk)
  [#435](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/435)

* If Swift version is not specified, look for Swift toolchain or clang location
  in the following order:

    * `$XCODE_DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_OVERRIDE`
    * `$TOOLCHAIN_DIR`
    * `xcrun -find swift`
    * `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`
    * `/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`
    * `~/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`
    * `~/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`

  This will be especially useful once jazzy supports generating docs for
  Swift Package Manager modules with a toolchain not tied to an Xcode release.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

##### Bug Fixes

* Don't document clang-unexposed Objective-C declarations.

  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#427](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/427)

  [#544](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/544)

## 0.6.0

##### Breaking

* Config files now use the same option names as the command line. If you are
  using one of the keys that has changed in your `.jazzy.yaml`, you will receive
  a warning. See the [pull request](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/pull/456) for
  a complete list of changed options. As always, you can get a list of all
  options with `jazzy --help config`.  
  [Paul Cantrell](https://github.com/pcantrell)

* Jazzy's undocumented.txt has been replaced with undocumented.json. This new
  format includes contextual information that one might use to lint
  documentation in an automated fashion.  
  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)

  is still generated.  
  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)

* Merge Objective-C categories into their parent type documentation to match
  Swift behavior.  
  [Esad Hajdarevic](https://github.com/esad)
  [#457](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/457)

* Add support for documenting Swift 2.2 `associatedtype`s and infix, postfix &
  prefix operators.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#452](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/452)

  to be merged into the wrong type.  
  [Paul Cantrell](https://github.com/pcantrell)
  [#459](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/459)
  [#460](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/460)

## 0.5.0

##### Breaking

* `--swift-version` now defaults to 2.1.1 instead of 2.1.  
  [Nikita Lutsenko](https://github.com/nlutsenko)
  [#416](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/pull/416)

* Swift 1.x is no longer supported.

* `--templates-directory` and `--assets-directory` have been deprecated in favor
  of `--theme`. Specify either 'apple' (default), 'fullwidth' or the path to
  your mustache templates and other assets for a custom theme.  
  [Karl Bowden](https://github.com/agentk)
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#130](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/130)

##### Enhancements

  projects.  
  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)

  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

##### Bug Fixes

* Fix an issue where extension documentation would use the original type
  documentation block rather than the comment immediately preceding the
  extension.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#230](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/230)
  [#313](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/313)

## 0.4.1

*Note: this is the last official release of jazzy supporting Swift 1.x.*

##### Breaking

  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)
  [#347](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/347)

* Expanding a token no longer causes the document to 'jump' to the hash.  
  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)
  [#352](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/352)

* Autolinking improvements:
  - Autolinks only match `` `ThingsInBackticks` ``, and must match the entire
    string. This prevents spurious matching in prose and sample code.
  - Autolinks supports siblings, ancestors, top-level elements, and
    dot-separated chains starting with any of the above: `someProperty`,
    `SomeType.NestedType.someMethod(_:)`.
  - New `...` wildcard prevents you from having to list all method parameters:
    `someMethod(...)`

  [#387](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/387)

* Links to source files on GitHub are no longer broken when `source_directory`
  does not point to the current working directory.  
  [Paul Cantrell](https://github.com/pcantrell)

* When `excluded_files` is specified in a config file, it is now resolved
  relative to the file (like other options) instead of relative to the working
  directory.  
  [Paul Cantrell](https://github.com/pcantrell)

* Render special list items (e.g. Throws, See, etc.). See
  http://ericasadun.com/2015/06/14/swift-header-documentation-in-xcode-7/ for
  a complete list.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#317](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/317)

* Support for Swift 2.1.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

  to describe extension default implementations and extension methods.  
  [Paul Cantrell](https://github.com/pcantrell)
