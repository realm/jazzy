* Section headings can now include additional markdown content using the
  `--abstract` option.  
  [Karl Bowden](https://github.com/agentk)
  [#435](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/435)

* If Swift version is not specified, look for Swift toolchain or clang location
  in the following order:

    * `$XCODE_DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_OVERRIDE`
    * `$TOOLCHAIN_DIR`
    * `xcrun -find swift`
    * `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`
    * `/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`
    * `~/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`
    * `~/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`

  This will be especially useful once jazzy supports generating docs for
  Swift Package Manager modules with a toolchain not tied to an Xcode release.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

  [#544](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/544)

## 0.6.0

##### Breaking

* Config files now use the same option names as the command line. If you are
  using one of the keys that has changed in your `.jazzy.yaml`, you will receive
  a warning. See the [pull request](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/pull/456) for
  a complete list of changed options. As always, you can get a list of all
  options with `jazzy --help config`.  
  [Paul Cantrell](https://github.com/pcantrell)

* Jazzy's undocumented.txt has been replaced with undocumented.json. This new
  format includes contextual information that one might use to lint
  documentation in an automated fashion.

  Swift behavior.  
  [Esad Hajdarevic](https://github.com/esad)

  documentation block rather than the comment immediately preceding the
  extension.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#230](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/230)

  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)
  [#347](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/347)

  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)
  [#352](https://github.com/realm/jazzy/issues/352)

* Autolinking improvements:
  - Autolinks only match `` `ThingsInBackticks` ``, and must match the entire
    string. This prevents spurious matching in prose and sample code.
  - Autolinks supports siblings, ancestors, top-level elements, and
    dot-separated chains starting with any of the above: `someProperty`,
    `SomeType.NestedType.someMethod(_:)`.
  - New `...` wildcard prevents you from having to list all method parameters:
    `someMethod(...)`

* Links to source files on GitHub are no longer broken when `source_directory`
  does not point to the current working directory.  
  [Paul Cantrell](https://github.com/pcantrell)

* When `excluded_files` is specified in a config file, it is now resolved
  relative to the file (like other options) instead of relative to the working
  directory.
