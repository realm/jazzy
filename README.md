*jazzy is a command-line utility that generates documentation for Swift or Objective-C*

## About

Both Swift and Objective-C projects are supported.

*SwiftPM support was recently added, so please report any issues you find.*

Instead of parsing your source files, `jazzy` hooks into [Clang][clang] and
[SourceKit][sourcekit] to use the [AST][ast] representation of your code and
its comments for more accurate results. The output matches the look and feel
of Apple’s official reference documentation, post WWDC 2014.

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://realm.io/conduct).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to [info@realm.io](mailto:info@realm.io).

## Requirements

You need development tools to build the project you wish to document.  Jazzy supports
both [Xcode][xcode] and [Swift Package Manager][spm] projects.

Jazzy expects to be running on __macOS__.  See [below](#linux) for tips to run Jazzy
on Linux.

## Installation

```shell
[sudo] gem install jazzy
```

See [Installation Problems](#installation-problems) for solutions to some
common problems.

## Usage

Run `jazzy` from your command line. Run `jazzy -h` for a list of additional options.

If your Swift module is the first thing to build, and it builds fine when running
`xcodebuild` or `swift build` without any arguments from the root of your project, then
just running `jazzy` (without any arguments) from the root of your project should
succeed too!

You can set options for your project’s documentation in a configuration file,
`.jazzy.yaml` by default. For a detailed explanation and an exhaustive list of
all available options, run `jazzy --help config`.

### Supported keywords

Swift documentation is written in markdown and supports a number of special keywords.
For a complete list and examples, see Erica Sadun's post on [*Swift header documentation in Xcode 7*](https://ericasadun.com/2015/06/14/swift-header-documentation-in-xcode-7/),
her [book on Swift Documentation Markup](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-documentation-markup/id1049010423), and the [Xcode Markup Formatting Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/).

For Objective-C documentation the same keywords are supported, but note that the format
is slightly different. In Swift you would write `- returns:`, but in Objective-C you write `@return`. See Apple's [*HeaderDoc User Guide*](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/HeaderDoc/tags/tags.html) for more details. **Note: `jazzy` currently does not support _all_ Objective-C keywords listed in this document, only @param, @return, @warning, @see, and @note.**

Jazzy can also generate cross-references within your documentation. A symbol name in
backticks generates a link, for example:
* \`MyClass\` - a link to documentation for `MyClass`.
* \`MyClass.method(param1:)\` - a link to documentation for that method.
* \`MyClass.method(...)\` - shortcut syntax for the same thing.
* \`method(...)\` - shortcut syntax to link to `method` from the documentation of another
  method or property in the same class.
* \`[MyClass method1]\` - a link to an Objective-C method.
* \`-[MyClass method2:param1]\` - a link to another Objective-C method.

### Swift

Swift documentation is generated by default.

##### Example

This is how Realm Swift docs are generated:

```shell
jazzy \
  --clean \
  --author Realm \
  --author_url https://realm.io \
  --github_url https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa \
  --github-file-prefix https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/tree/v0.96.2 \
  --module-version 0.96.2 \
  --build-tool-arguments -scheme,RealmSwift \
  --module RealmSwift \
  --root-url https://realm.io/docs/swift/0.96.2/api/ \
  --output docs/swift_output \
  --theme docs/themes
```

This is how docs are generated for a project that uses the Swift Package Manager:

```shell
jazzy \
  --module DeckOfPlayingCards \
  --swift-build-tool spm \
  --build-tool-arguments -Xswiftc,-swift-version,-Xswiftc,5
```

### Objective-C

To generate documentation for Objective-C headers, you must pass the following
parameters to jazzy:

* `--objc`
* `--umbrella-header ...`
* `--framework-root ...`
* `--sdk [iphone|watch|appletv][os|simulator]|macosx` (optional, default value
   of `macosx`)
* `--hide-declarations [objc|swift]` (optional, hides the selected language
   declarations)

##### Example

This is how Realm Objective-C docs are generated:

```shell
jazzy \
  --objc \
  --clean \
  --author Realm \
  --author_url https://realm.io \
  --github_url https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa \
  --github-file-prefix https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/tree/v2.2.0 \
  --module-version 2.2.0 \
  --build-tool-arguments --objc,Realm/Realm.h,--,-x,objective-c,-isysroot,$(xcrun --show-sdk-path),-I,$(pwd) \
  --module Realm \
  --root-url https://realm.io/docs/objc/2.2.0/api/ \
  --output docs/objc_output \
  --head "$(cat docs/custom_head.html)"
```

This is how the AFNetworking docs are generated:

```shell
jazzy \
  --objc \
  --author AFNetworking \
  --author_url http://afnetworking.com \
  --github_url https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking \
  --github-file-prefix https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/tree/2.6.2 \
  --module-version 2.6.2 \
  --umbrella-header AFNetworking/AFNetworking.h \
  --framework-root . \
  --module AFNetworking
```

### Mixed Objective-C / Swift

*This feature is new and has some rough edges.*

To generate documentation for a mixed Swift and Objective-C project you must first
generate two [SourceKitten][sourcekitten] files: one for Swift and one for Objective-C.

Then pass these files to Jazzy together using `--sourcekitten-sourcefile`.

#### Example

This is how docs are generated from an Xcode project for a module containing both
Swift and Objective-C files:

```shell
# Generate Swift SourceKitten output
sourcekitten doc -- -workspace MyProject.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme > swiftDoc.json

# Generate Objective-C SourceKitten output
sourcekitten doc --objc $(pwd)/MyProject/MyProject.h \
      -- -x objective-c  -isysroot $(xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk iphonesimulator) \
      -I $(pwd) -fmodules > objcDoc.json

# Feed both outputs to Jazzy as a comma-separated list
jazzy --sourcekitten-sourcefile swiftDoc.json,objcDoc.json
```

### Themes

Three themes are provided with jazzy: `apple` (default), `fullwidth` and `jony`.

* `apple` example: <https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/api/>
* `fullwidth` example: <https://reduxkit.github.io/ReduxKit/>
* `jony` example: <https://harshilshah.github.io/IGListKit/>

You can specify which theme to use by passing in the `--theme` option. You can
also provide your own custom theme by passing in the path to your theme
directory.

### Guides

| Description | Command |
| ---         | ---     |
| Command line option | `--documentation={file pattern}` |
| Example             | `--documentation=Docs/*.md` |
| jazzy.yaml example  | `documentation: Docs/*.md` |

By default, jazzy looks for one of README.md, README.markdown, README.mdown or README (in that order) in the directory from where it runs to render the index page at the root of the docs output directory.
Using the `--documentation` option, extra markdown files can be integrated into the generated docs and sidebar navigation.

Any files found matching the file pattern will be parsed and included as a document with the type 'Guide' when generated. If the files are not included using the `custom_categories` config option, they will be grouped under 'Other Guides' in the sidebar navigation.

There are a few limitations:
- File names must be unique from source files.
- Readme should be specified separately using the `readme` option.

### Section description abstracts

| Description | Command |
| ---         | ---     |
| Command line option | `--abstract={file pattern}` |
| Example             | `--abstract=Docs/Sections/*.md` |
| jazzy.yaml example  | `abstract: Docs/Sections/*.md` |

Using the `--abstract` options, extra markdown can be included after the heading of section overview pages. Think of it as a template include.

The list of files matching the pattern is compared against the list of sections generated and if a match is found, it's contents will be included in that section before listing source output.

Unlike the `--documentation` option, these files are not included in navigation and if a file does not match a section title, it is not included at all.

This is very helpful when using `custom_categories` for grouping types and including relevant documentation in those sections.

For an example of a project using both `--documentation` and `--abstract` see: [https://reswift.github.io/ReSwift/](https://reswift.github.io/ReSwift/)

### Controlling what is documented

In Swift mode, Jazzy by default documents only `public` and `open` declarations. To
include declarations with a lower access level, set the `--min-acl` flag to `internal`,
`fileprivate`, or `private`.

In Objective-C mode, Jazzy documents all declarations found in the `--umbrella-header`
header file and any other header files included by it.

You can control exactly which declarations should be documented using `--exclude`,
`--include`, or `:nodoc:`.

The `--include` and `--exclude` flags list source files that should be included/excluded
respectively in the documentation. Entries in the list can be absolute pathnames beginning
with `/` or relative pathnames. Relative pathnames are interpreted relative to the
directory from where you run `jazzy` or, if the flags are set in the config file, relative
to the directory containing the config file. Entries in the list can match multiple files
using `*` to match any number of characters including `/`.  For example:
* `jazzy --include=/Users/fred/project/Sources/Secret.swift` -- include a specific file
* `jazzy --exclude=/*/Internal*` -- exclude all files with names that begin with *Internal*
  and any files under any directory with a name beginning *Internal*.
* `jazzy --exclude=Impl1/*,Impl2/*` -- exclude all files under the directories *Impl1* and
  *Impl2* found in the current directory.

Note that the `--include` option is applied before the `--exclude` option. For example:

* `jazzy --include=/*/Internal* --exclude=Impl1/*,Impl2/*` -- include all files with names
  that begin with *Internal* and any files under any directory with a name beginning
  *Internal*, **except** for those under the directories *Impl1* and *Impl2* found in the
  current directory

Declarations with a documentation comment containing `:nodoc:` are excluded from the
documentation.

### Choosing the Swift language version

Jazzy normally uses the Swift compiler from the Xcode currently configured by
`xcode-select`.  Use the `--swift-version` flag to compile with a different
Xcode.

The value you pass to `--swift-version` must be the Swift language version given
by `swift --version` in the Xcode you want to use.

For example to use Xcode 9.4:
```shell
jazzy --swift-version 4.1.2
```

## Linux

Jazzy uses [SourceKitten][sourcekitten] to communicate with the Swift build
environment and compiler.  The `sourcekitten` binary included in the Jazzy gem
is built for macOS and so does not run on other operating systems.

To use Jazzy on Linux you first need to install and build `sourcekitten`
following instructions from [SourceKitten's GitHub repository][sourcekitten].

Then to generate documentation for a SwiftPM project, instead of running just
`jazzy` do:
```shell
sourcekitten doc --spm > doc.json
jazzy --sourcekitten-sourcefile doc.json
```

We hope to improve this process in the future.

## Troubleshooting

### Swift

**Only extensions are listed in the documentation?**

Check the `--min-acl` setting -- see [above](#controlling-what-is-documented).

**Unable to find an Xcode with swift version X**

1. The value passed with `--swift-version` must exactly match the version
   number from `swiftc --version`.  For example Xcode 10.1 needs
   `--swift-version 4.2.1`.  See [the flag documentation](#choosing-the-swift-language-version).
2. The Xcode you want to use must be in the Spotlight index.  You can check
   this using `mdfind 'kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier == com.apple.dt.Xcode'`.
   Some users have reported this issue being fixed by a reboot; `mdutil -E`
   may also help.  If none of these work then you can set the `DEVELOPER_DIR`
   environment variable to point to the Xcode you want before running Jazzy
   without the `--swift-version` flag.

### Installation Problems

**Can't find header files / clang**

Some of the Ruby gems that Jazzy depends on have native C extensions.  This
means you need the Xcode command-line developer tools installed to build
them: run `xcode-select --install` to install the tools.

**/Applications/Xcode: No such file or directory**

The path of your active Xcode installation must not contain spaces.  So
`/Applications/Xcode.app/` is fine, `/Applications/Xcode-10.2.app/` is fine,
but `/Applications/Xcode 10.2.app/` is not.  This restriction applies only
when *installing* Jazzy, not running it.

### MacOS Before 10.14.4

Starting with Jazzy 0.10.0, if you see an error similar to `dyld: Symbol not found: _$s11SubSequenceSlTl` then you need to install the [Swift 5 Runtime Support for Command Line Tools](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1998).

Alternatively, you can:
* Update to macOS 10.14.4 or later; or
* Install Xcode 10.2 or later at `/Applications/Xcode.app`.

## Development
